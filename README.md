* Proposal: Suggested feature, collecting feedback. Not implemented in any way. 
* Alpha: Implementation exists to try out the feature. Might get cancelled, might have breaking changes. Not guaranteed to be available.
* Beta: Implementation is available, although on hardware there might be a waiting list. Breaking changes are avoided, but possible if something critical is found. Intended to move into production. 
* In production: Mature feature which can be used as a part of your business. 
* Deprecated: Feature will be removed in a future release. If you're using this feature, please migrate to a feature which is in production or contact Ruuvi team as soon as possible to discuss your needs in the future.
