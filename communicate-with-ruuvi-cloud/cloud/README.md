# Ruuvi Cloud

## Overview

Ruuvi Network (Serverless) is divided into two core APIs:

1. Gateway API
2. User API
3. Internal API

Gateway API handles receiving and storing data sent by Ruuvi Gateways to Ruuvi Network. User API is the User facing API for creating and editing user information and retrieving user data as well as claiming and sharing tags.
