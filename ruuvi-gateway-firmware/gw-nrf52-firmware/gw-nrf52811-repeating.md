# GW nRF52811 repeating

nRF52811 Could listen in to advertisements and repeat them for other devices. For example if there is a sensor broadcasting at Long Range PHY once per 6 seconds, Gateway could repeat the advertisement at faster interval at 1 MBit / s PHY for mobile phones etc devices which aren't explicitly designed to scan for BLE advertisements.
