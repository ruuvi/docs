In this step, Ruuvi Gateway checks for software updates.

If a newer version is available, the gateway will offer to update the firmware:

You can set up your own server for firmware updates, and you can configure it's address in the "**Advanced settings**" section:

You can also install earlier or beta versions of the software by providing the URL to the required firmware. If you have built your own firmware, you can run HTTP server and provide the URL to your firmware binaries (See [gw-install-custom-firmware.md](../gw-install-custom-firmware.md "mention")).
