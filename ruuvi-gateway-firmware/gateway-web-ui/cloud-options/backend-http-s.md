Or configure to send data to your own server via HTTP/HTTPS (it is possible to send data to both destinations, Ruuvi Cloud and your own server, at the same time):

It also supports client authentication via SSL by enabling the upload of a client certificate and its associated private key, ensuring secure and verified client-server communication:

You can use a server SSL Certificate if you want to be independent of public Certificate Authorities (CAs) or if you have deployed a self-signed certificate on the HTTPS server, giving you greater control and customization over your security infrastructure:
