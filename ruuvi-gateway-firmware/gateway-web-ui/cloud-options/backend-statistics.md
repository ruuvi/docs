When using your own server, you and use basic authentication and/or use client authentication via SSL by enabling the upload of a client certificate and its associated private key, ensuring secure and verified client-server communication. Also, you can use a server SSL Certificate if you want to be independent of public Certificate Authorities (CAs) or if you have deployed a self-signed certificate on the HTTPS server, giving you greater control and customization over your security infrastructure:
