# Access Settings from LAN

On this page, you can set access rules to Ruuvi Gateway from the local network. By default, the access is password protected using the default password (unique device ID which is printed on the bottom of Ruuvi Gateway).

It is also possible to access Ruuvi Gateway from LAN using bearer authentication with an API key (token). You can enable read-only access (to retrieve data in [polling-mode.md](../../examples/polling-mode.md "mention") via the /history endpoint) or read-write access (to read any data or change the configuration):
